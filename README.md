# Fourier-Visualizations
Visualizing Fourier series approximations of waves and how they relate to digital oscillators producing sound.

See and hear it here: http://bgrawi.com/Fourier-Visualizations/

## Tips and things to try

* Adjust your volume then click on the speaker in the top right to hear the wave @ 220hz
* Try sliding the n slider or use your arrow keys to change how many terms there are
* Select the middle silder to hear only one term at a time, then toggle it back to hear that one frequency help form the overall wave
* Try pausing the simulation, then stepping with the S key (or the button) when theta is 0 or pi.
* Listen to how the ringing goes away when the Lanczos sigma factor is added and notice how the wave is actually louder

## To do
* Refactor out into separte files for better management
* Explore other waveforms
* Show the actual audio output oscilloscope complete with normalization and zooming
